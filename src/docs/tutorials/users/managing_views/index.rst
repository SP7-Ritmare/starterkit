Managing views
==============

Views (also called maps) are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest.

In this section, we’ll create a view based on the layers uploaded in the previous section, combine them with some existing layers and a remote web service layer, and then share the resulting view for public viewing. You will also learn how to create standard metadata for views.
