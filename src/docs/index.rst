GET-IT documentation
********************
Welcome to GET-IT documentation!

The Geoinformation Enabling ToolkIT starterkitÂ® (GET-IT) is an Open Source software for geospatial data and metadata management. 
It allows the user to upload, store, visualize and share data on the Web through Open Geospatial Consoritum (OGC) standard services. 
GET-IT users can manage traditional geographic data (layers, maps) and observations from sensors using simple web form accessible through a single graphic user interface (GUI). GET-IT also include EDI to create metadata according to international profiles (INSPIRE, RNDT, SensorML).


How To Use The Documentation
=====================

The documentation is geared toward three distinct types of users: 

* **Users**: are people who log into GET-IT web form and use its functionalities.
* **Administrators**: are people who install and deploy GET-IT for their Users.
* **Developers**: are people who write code to add functionalities, integrate with other systems, fix bugs, and potentially help an Administrator to setup a server and deploy a GET-IT instance.

The documentation is divided into three sections:

* :ref:`presentation`: a short presentation of GET-IT features and its functionalities.
* :ref:`users`: step-by-step instructions in workshop format that help different users to accomplish a set of tasks.
* :ref:`publication`: information about the project, how to contribute, links, resources, other info.
